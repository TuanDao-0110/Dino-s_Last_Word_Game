# Hangman Game with React & Redux Toolkit

This is a Hangman game built with React and Redux Toolkit. The game allows the user to guess a randomly generated word by entering letters one at a time. The user has a limited number of incorrect guesses, and each incorrect guess adds a part to a hangman figure. The game is won by guessing the word before the hangman is fully drawn, or lost by making too many incorrect guesses.
