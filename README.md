# Hangman Game with React & Redux Toolkit

[Play it live!](https://dino-game-guesting.onrender.com/)

![Screenshot](./front-end/src/assets/dino_screenshot_small.png)

A simple Hangman-inspired game, except it's dinosaur vs. meteor. The game allows the user to guess a randomly generated word by entering letters one at a time. The user has a limited number of incorrect guesses, and each incorrect guess adds a part to a hangman figure. The game is won by guessing the word before the hangman is fully drawn, or lost by making too many incorrect guesses.

## Features

1. Word is randomly generated from many categories.
2. Player can choose to play all categories to get 2 point per completed round, or play a specific category and get 1 point per round.
3. Hint feature: player can click any unopened letter to show it, which deducts 1 point from the user's score.
4. With each incorrect guess the meteor gets closer and closer to the ground. When it hits the ground, dino dies and the game is over ðŸ˜¢
5. Player can see leaderboard of all players' scores.
6. Player can store their score and join the leaderboard by logging in / signing up.
